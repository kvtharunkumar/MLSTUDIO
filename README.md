# MLSTUDIO
ML Studio is a supervised machine learning platform that allows to develop machine learning models with minimal developer influence.
dataset is taken as input, Feature selection, Algorithm selection, Train test split. Based on selection, Model is trained and converted into pickle file. 
The accuracy of the model depends on the dataset and the algorithm chosen. A NoSQL database is used to store and retrieve the pickle files. 
These files are able to download and can be used further in Python Script.
