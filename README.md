ML Studio is a supervised machine learning platform that allows to develop machine learning models with minimal developer influence.
the dataset uploaded by the user, Feature selection, Algorithm selection, Train test split. Based on selection, Model is trained and converted into pickle file. The accuracy of the model depends on the dataset and the algorithm chosen.

## Training the model
select the dataset to upload
select the features, algorithm and trian test ratio and click train.
the model will we trianed based on selection, download th pickle file use in pyscripts.
